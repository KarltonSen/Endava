# Endava Technical Interview

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

## Project Setup
- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. For documentation on how to do this, please visit: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
- Open the project locally
- Create a new branch in the newly forked repo using the naming convention **yourFirstName_yourLastName**. This is where your work should be saved.
- To run the project run the following command in the project directory: `ng serve` 
- Open http://localhost:4200 to view it in the browser.
- To better understand the workflow process, view [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAtPrOrRPs) on how to fork a repository, and open a pull request to merge branches within a forked repository

## Task
Create a blog website that dynamically renders a list of sample blogs from different authors. The site should include, but is not limited to:
- A home page displaying a selection of blogs from each author. It doesn't matter how you choose which blogs to render from each author. 
- An author page that displays all the blogs for a specific author.

The webpage may be designed any way that you would like. Feel free to modify existing files or create new files. You can add some new dependencies if you choose.
Please spend no more than 4 hours on this task

## Data
You should use this [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to load the data for your webpage. 

## Resources
You may use any internet sources to aid your implementation. [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) has great documentation if you get stuck/need help.

## Submitting Your Work (IMPORTANT!)
When you are finished, create a Pull Request in Github for the forked repository. This Pull Request should compare two branches, BOTH on your forked repository; so, the branch you created on your forked repo should be compared to the default **main** branch ALSO on your forked repo. Email the link to your Pull Request to nicole.niemczycki@endava.com at least 24 hours before your technical interview
